The Random Featured Post plugin allows you to display a random post from a designated category as a "featured" post.

== Description ==

The Random Featured Post plugin allows you to display a random post from a designated category. Ideally this should draw readers landing on your homepage to some of your best posts. The featured post will display the title "Featured Post" (customizable) along with the post's title, an excerpt and a link to continue to the full post.

== Installation ==

1. Download and unzip to your plugin folder.
2. Activate the plugin from the Plugins section of your dashboard.
3. (Optional) Create a "Featured" category.
4. Go to the "Featured Post" options in your dashboard and select the categories from which you would like posts to be randomly selected.
5. Check the "Show Posts" box and click "Update" to save your changes.
6. Place a call to the show\_posts\_fade() function in your template, most likely in your main index template just before the loop.
